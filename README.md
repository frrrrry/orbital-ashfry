# Motivation 

Do you want to stop telling your friends or yourself that you are broke and can’t afford to buy anything? Do you want to start working towards your goal of buying that new gaming PC that you have been eyeing on since forever but you have no money to afford? 

Many find it a hassle to manually track whether they are spending over their allowance or spending limit as in our fast-paced society, it is hard to find the time to search for every single printed or online receipt that we have accumulated and calculate the total amount by hand. Also, you may want to work towards your savings goals but it is annoying to keep calculating your expenditures by hand. 

Therefore, we hope to create a centralized platform that solves such troubles and worries of people facing such issues so that people can efficiently and easily keep track of their expenses and work towards their savings goals.

# Aim

We hope to make a mobile app for people to keep track of their expenditures for them to maintain a healthy habit of saving money.

# User Stories

1. As a broke college student I would like to record my daily expenses and ensure that I am spending within my budget.

2. As a thrifty person, I can see my total spending in a day to keep track of my expenditure and ensure that it does not exceed a certain amount. 

3. As a big fan of BlackPink, a kpop group, I would like to save up money to go to their concert and hence I would like to record how much money I have saved to eventually achieve my goal of buying their concert ticket before the ticket sales date.
